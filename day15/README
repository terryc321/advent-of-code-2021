if we make movement choices semi-random
have several processes all working on their own search
find we get better results

how can we coordinate between the search processes such that

master process
proc1  - 702
proc2  - 712
proc3  - 732
proc4  - 742
proc5  - 752
proc6  - 722
proc7  - 590
proc8  - 690
proc9   - 802
proc10   - 703
proc11  - 432
proc12   - 432
proc13  - 456


how can i get all processes to look at master and see aha ! there is maximum cost which
we cannot exceed so stop search if cost is exceeded ...







lets suppose in general if can only move up left right or down on 2d matrix

  C
A ? B
  D

the cost of getting to square ? is through one of A , B , C or D

then the minimum cost of ? will be min (A,B,C,D) + cost of ? itself

A C D G K P V
B E H L Q W
F I M R X
J N S Y 
O T Z
U A2
B2




see SPEC file for ideas on how to think about the problem

SPEC file is a way to think about this problem , devoid of programming concerns

macro1.scm
can do simple macro that does not take expression apart
is implicit renaming ir-macro the better ?


compiling solve2.scm ?

auto generated file solve2.scm seems to pose a big problem for scheme
compilers

10,000 procedures 100 x 100 matrix where simply adding a value from
grid to minimum of neighbour below and to right

taken from advent of code 2021 day 15

get result 408
but aoc says nope
now says 404 , top left square has 0 risk as do not enter it , it used as
start point according to rules does not contribute to risk
